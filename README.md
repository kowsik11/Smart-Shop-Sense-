# üõçÔ∏è Product Recommendation System

## üöÄ Problem Identification
1. **Data Quality and Quantity**: Inadequate or sparse data can reduce the accuracy of recommendation systems, making it hard to identify user preferences.
2. **Cold Start Problem**: When there is little or no historical data for new users or products, recommendation systems struggle to make accurate suggestions.
3. **Content Overload Management**: The rapid growth of digital content makes it difficult to efficiently extract insights without overwhelming the system.

In the era of e-commerce, a machine learning-based recommendation system is crucial for understanding user behavior and purchase history, leading to personalized product suggestions that can significantly improve customer satisfaction and sales. Failing to provide this personalization may lead to lower sales and customer disengagement.

## üìå Problem Statement
Develop an efficient and accurate **product recommendation system** that enhances user engagement by suggesting personalized products.

## üåü Significance
1. **Improved Sales and Revenue**: Personalized recommendations foster loyalty and increase sales by providing relevant product suggestions.
2. **Customer Satisfaction**: By showing users products they are more likely to enjoy, recommendation systems improve overall satisfaction and encourage repeat business.

## üéØ Objectives, Scope, and Limitations

### Objectives
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose the best machine learning models for making accurate recommendations.
- **Cold Start Problem**: Address challenges related to new users and products without sufficient data.

### Scope
- **Increase Sales and Repeated Business**: Personalized recommendations help boost sales by targeting customer preferences.
- **Reduce Information Overload**: Assist customers in finding relevant products, avoiding content overload.
- **Upselling Strategy**: Help analyze the benefits and outcomes of upselling strategies.
  
### Limitations
- **Cold Start Problem**: Recommending for new users/products remains challenging due to lack of historical data.
- **Data Sparsity**: Insufficient data may reduce accuracy in certain cases.
- **Scalability**: As the dataset and users grow, the system must handle increasing loads while maintaining performance.

## üìä Dataset Information
This project utilizes a dataset comprising over **2 million customer reviews** and ratings for beauty-related products from Amazon. Key features include:
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Amazon Product IDs (ASIN)**: Unique product identifier.
- **Customer Satisfaction Ratings (1-5)**: Ratings provided by customers.
- **Timestamp (UNIX Time)**: Date and time of the review.
